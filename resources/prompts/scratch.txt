Here is a conversation between a few users. What related topics might these users be interested in?

{{conversation}}


```
Based on these topics, what are some very short questions the users would be interested in answering?

Here are some examples of the style of questions I am looking for:

- What do you think you know about [topic] that your friends don't?
- Why do you find [topic] interesting?
- How did you encounter [topic] in the first place?
- Why is [topic] on your mind?
```

```
Pick the top 3 that you think the user is most likely to want to answer. 
Assume the user will see the questions later and maybe forgot about this conversation.
Reply only with the questions, one per line.
Please rephrase the questions if needed for them to be short
