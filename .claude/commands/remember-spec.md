We have implemented a long specificiation into the codebase. The user will give you the documentation for that specification and / or the completed implementation plan.

Your goal is to summarize the spec and what will be relevant to developers of this codebase now that the feature exists. Claude Code supports having CLAUDE.md files at many levels. So, start by either finding or making the CLAUDE.md file at the lowest level of the project that makes sense. That CLAUDE.md can be slightly more detailed. 

And then, progressively move upwards into different directories. Wherever you find another CLAUDE.md, add another reference to the spec. The higher you go, the shorter your summary should be. At the top level, for many specs you shouldn't add anyhing. Check if the CLAUDE.md you are writing already has what you are adding. If it does, either skip or add there whatever important info is missing.

Restrict yourself to:

- two or three short sections for the most detailed CLAUDE.md
- one or two sentences for the next level
- a few words or nothing at the top level
