Enable React Native's New Architecture in the Gatz chat app as a separate task after successful SDK 52 upgrade, with full commitment to the new architecture and comprehensive validation.

## Prerequisites
- **Expo SDK 52**: Must be successfully upgraded and stable first
- **React Native 0.77.x**: Auto-updated with SDK 52
- **Hermes**: Must be enabled (required for New Architecture)

## Implementation Requirements

**Core Configuration:**
1. **App Config Update**: Add `newArchEnabled: true` to root of expo object in `app.config.js`
2. **Native Directories**: Clean regenerate iOS/Android directories with `npx expo prebuild --clean`
3. **Build Commands**: Use `npx expo run:ios` and `npx expo run:android` or EAS builds

**Validation and Testing:**
4. **Dependency Compatibility**: Run `npx expo-doctor@latest` to identify incompatible libraries
5. **Manual Testing**: Comprehensive testing on iOS, Android, and web platforms
6. **Performance Measurement**: Measure and document performance before/after New Architecture

**Library Compatibility:**
7. **Replace Incompatible Libraries**: Immediately replace any libraries identified as incompatible:
   - `react-native-lightbox-v2` → Find New Architecture compatible alternative
   - `react-native-markdown-package` → Replace if incompatible
   - `react-native-typing-animation` → Replace if incompatible
   - `react-native-communications` → Replace if incompatible
   - `posthog-react-native` → Verify/update to compatible version

**Vendor Dependencies:**
8. **Update Vendor Packages**: Ensure all custom vendor packages in `/app/vendor/` support New Architecture:
   - react-native-image-gallery
   - react-native-phone-number-input
   - react-native-country-picker-modal

**Build and Deployment:**
9. **EAS Development Builds**: Create new development builds immediately after enabling
10. **JSI/TurboModule Support**: Verify all native modules support TurboModules/Fabric
11. **Debugging Setup**: Configure React Native DevTools for New Architecture

**Migration Strategy:**
- **Full Commitment**: No rollback plan, commit fully to New Architecture
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Use expo-doctor + extensive manual testing
- **Performance Focus**: Measure and validate performance improvements

## Success Criteria
- ✅ `newArchEnabled: true` configured in app config
- ✅ `npx expo-doctor@latest` reports no compatibility issues
- ✅ App builds successfully on iOS, Android, and web
- ✅ All incompatible libraries replaced with compatible alternatives
- ✅ EAS development builds created and functional
- ✅ Performance metrics measured and documented
- ✅ Manual testing confirms no regressions
- ✅ All vendor dependencies support New Architecture

## Performance Validation
- **Before Metrics**: Document current app performance baselines
- **After Metrics**: Measure startup time, render performance, memory usage
- **Comparison**: Document improvements/changes with New Architecture

## Risk Mitigation
- **No Rollback Strategy**: Full commitment approach requires thorough validation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive manual testing to catch issues early
- **Library Replacement**: Proactive replacement of incompatible libraries
