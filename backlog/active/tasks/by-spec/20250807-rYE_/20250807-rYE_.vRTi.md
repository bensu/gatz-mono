Create migration screen UI that shows once, then displays reminder banner on subsequent app opens.

## Requirements
- Create migration screen component for first-time prompt
- Create dismissible reminder banner for subsequent visits
- Integrate with /me endpoint migration status
- Handle user interaction (migrate now, remind later)
- Track migration screen display state
- Provide clear messaging about why migration is needed

## Implementation Details
- New migration screen component with Apple/Google auth buttons
- Dismissible banner component for follow-up reminders
- Local storage to track if migration screen was already shown
- Integration with existing Apple/Google auth flows
- Clear, user-friendly messaging about migration benefits
- "Contact Support" option if auth fails

## User Flow
1. User opens app, /me endpoint returns migration.required = true
2. If first time: Show full-screen migration prompt
3. User can "Migrate Now" or "Remind Me Later"
4. If "Remind Later": Show banner on subsequent app opens
5. Once migrated: No more migration prompts

## UI Components
- **Migration Screen**: Full-screen modal with explanation and auth buttons
- **Reminder Banner**: Top banner with "Add Apple/Google Account" button
- **Loading States**: During auth flow
- **Error States**: When auth fails, with support option

## Screen Content
- Clear explanation of benefits (faster sign-in, no SMS codes)
- Apple Sign-In button (iOS/macOS/web)
- Google Sign-In button (all platforms)
- "Contact Support" link
- "Remind Me Later" option

## Integration Points
- Use migration status from /me endpoint
- Call /auth/link-apple or /auth/link-google APIs
- Update user state after successful linking
- Handle auth flow errors gracefully
